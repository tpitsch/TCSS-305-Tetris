Tetris

Follows MVC design and uses the java awt and Swing packages.  

Given the model class containing the game board and pieces my code implements the view and control portions of the game.  Uses the awt and Swing packages to create the main frame of the game board as well as a small window containing the next piece and total score with the current level.  Controller consists of non changeable keys for movement and rotation.  A and  Left Arrow for left movement, D ,Right Arrow for right movement, S, Down Arrow for down movement, W, Up Arrow for piece rotation.  

Custom music loops until the game ends then plays the game over music and display total score and level.  

Game closely follows basic rules for the game of Tetris in most aspects.
